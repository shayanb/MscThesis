\begin{abstract}

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors, without whose their support and patience I could not have completed my master\'â€™s degree. I would like to thank Dr. Wahab Hamou-Lhadj, for pushing me to find the subject I really enjoyed working on, and Jeremy Clark, whose expertise, understanding, and patience, added considerably to my graduate experience.

\par I would like to express my appreciation and thanks to the great co-authors that helped me with publishing the Bitcoin usability paper, David Barrera and Elizabeth Stobert. 
\par A very special thanks goes out to Hamed Masoumi, for his valuable suggestions and cooperation to make Cafe Aunja the first caf\'{e} in Eastern Canada to accept Bitcoin.

\par I am also thankful to Montreal Bitcoin Embassy crowd, for offering a great environment to embrace the geek within me.
 
\par Last but not least, I would like to thank my parents and my sister for the support they provided me through my entire life.

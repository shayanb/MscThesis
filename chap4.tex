\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we evaluate all the existing Bitcoin wallet clients and came up with a framework to evaluate the upcoming softwares. We concluded that there's no perfect wallet client yet and we have a long way to go to have a perfect solution. We also evaluate the Bitcoin point of sales that accepted bitcoin and again there was no perfect solution for a small business to easily accept Bitcoins. We developed and deployed a custom point of sale for small businesses and published it as an open source application that has already been used by a few more small businesses all over the world.

These are small steps toward having a universal framework for Bitcoin softwares, but they are the first steps.

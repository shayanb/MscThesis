Highlight on PDF = something grammatically wrong (if you unsure, you can ask)
Expand all contractions (it’s -> it is, etc)

-[2] “Obvious” is a strong word
-[3] The company filed for bankruptcy not Chaum (he had left by then)

**[3] thesis statement, highlighted word "system"
--> what word to use instead of system?
- % systems

-[4] I’d say unregulated use instead of illegal use for e-gold
-[4] Expand on the idea that Bitcoin is its own currency, not a digital version of an existing currency like the USD (ecash) or commodity like Gold (e-gold)
-[4] any *published* work on the usability
-[5] as long as -> to the extent that it fits...
-[5] first ever -> first published
-[6] eastern canada: unclear what this means, just say Quebec even if it is broader
-[6] robust system: system for what? Be more specific
-[7] hold, use and accept -> holding, using and accepting
-[8] every transaction -> every standard transaction (also add a footnote saying that from now on, the word transaction refers to a standard transaction unless otherwise specified) (you can also define standard transaction if you want in no more than a sentence or two)

*[8] I think details of the conensus model are relevant to the PoS terminal because you need to think about double spending and confirmation times, which cannot be done without understanding the model.
--> added double spend and confirmation time details to clarify the consensus model

-[9] SPV also has integrity risks: semi-trusted nodes can omit reports of relevant transactions (but cannot forge transactions or convince a user that a transaction was added when it was not)

*[11] Don’t use other peoples images. Create your own!
--> all images in this thesis was created by me!

-[12] Satoshi -> As bitcoin creator Satoshi…

*[13] Create your own figures
--> see figures graffle directory for raw files (open with Omni graffle)

-[13] BIP32 also allows a dumb terminal that does not know the private key to generate new Bitcoin addresses (for use in PoS terminals)
-[14] misused -> conflated
-[14] Isn’t Bitcoin QT now called Bitcoin Core?
-[14] miners are computational devices, not necessarily computers (ASICs, FPGAs, GPUs aren’t computers)
-[14] should have -> should form… also explain *why*
-[14] don’t use words like “really”
-[15] Yes, explain double spend. Also explain why miners go along with valid blocks instead of forking. For details on this, you can look at the Princeton course on Bitcoin (which includes some textbook chapters)
-[16] Usability in title?
-[16] Don’t use Dr. in names (otherwise you’ll have to use it every time you refer to one: David Barrera, David Chaum, etc)

*[16—61] I skipped this as it is the paper, which I have obviously already read. Is it the full version of the paper? If this is the case, in the introduction of the chapter, say that this chapter is a longer version than the published paper. Also, is there anything outside of the conclusions that you changed? If so, let me know and I’ll read it in detail.
--> not that much was changed, mostly were moved to the other parts of the thesis.

**[33] Rotate the chart so it fills the page in landscape
--> How? Tried and failed miserably!
- % Try this: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/101645/how-to-turn-latex-figure-by-90-degrees-along-with-the-caption
Or google a bit and see. I don’t know off hand but know it can be done with the right package.

*[56] Make sure you understand section 3.7 as well as you would if you had written it. Or alternatively, you could add a footnote that notes the section is largely the work of your co-authors but is included for completeness. The point is, the committee can ask you detailed questions about this and you are expected to be able to answer them.
--> duly noted

-[62] Don’t like the title, it is too vague. “Bitcoin Point of Sale Terminals: evaluation and deployment”
-[62] bitcoin and use -> Bitcoin. We will use the SCRAM [citation!]

**[62] “Point of sale” needs a word like “terminal” at the end. Define PoS to be “point of sale terminal” then use PoS everywhere is the easiest fix.
--> what do you mean by "define"? just mentioning that PoS means point of sale terminal and we would use PoS from now on is enough?
% Yeah, just mean the first use say: Point of sale terminals (PoS) blah blah blah. Instead of Point of sale (PoS) terminals. Because then you’ll have to say PoS terminals all the time. 

-[62] “best suitable” this is vague and nothing is the “best” -> say something more specific, one that receives full points in our evaluation method or something like

*[62] One interesting aspect: I don’t understand this sentence 
--> I changed it, if it's still vague let me know and will probably get rid of it.

*[63] Give your system a name and then refer to it by that name. It will make everything easier.
--> Aunja PoS

-[63] “going through” -> eliciting; “browsed” -> researched; “and if” -> to see if; meet -> met

*[63] Stopping here for now…
--> Thanks a lot :)
=========================================================================================================================

-[64] Never copy figures. Make your own (citing where you got it from still) and only put in the details that are relevant to what you are going to use. 
-[65] What is a “client”? Do you mean the business? Should be distinguished from software clients in the previous section. 
-[66] “concept demonstrator” proof of concept?
~[70-1] Phrase all requirements positively: low cost to run, enables branching, maintains X’s privacy, provides authentication.
-[70] Branching is unclear. Do you mean install without modification?
-[71] Information leakage is unclear. How is it not captured by the other properties? Can you give some examples of such leakage?
-[71] Authentication is unclear. I think the requirement is a confidential payments list, while authentication is one means to achieve that (requirements should describe what i to be achieved not how you achieve it: “descriptive not proscriptive”). 
-[68-72] You need to say for each column in the table what it means to score a full dot, a half dot, and no dot.

*-[73+] You have to relate what you are saying in English to why you give a certain score (full dot, half dot, no dot)  under each criteria. See for example my SSL SoK paper or [BHvOS12] for what this looks like. 
--> This is the automated naming that turned it to [BHvOS12], should I change this?

-[78] Define “BIP32 path”
-[79] Anytime you run code, you are trusting a third party: the developer. But this is true of everything (OS, Bitcoin itself, etc). However you should clarify this somewhere.
-[82] Note quickly that propagating the transaction is not the same as confirming it but that this is an accepted risk.
-[83] “should not” ->  does not ?
-[83] drop “that is protected by password and”
-[84] Software dependencies: just a browser is required?

**[87] Is bitcoinaverage not a trusted third party now in your system?
-->bitcoinaverage would get the average of the price of all the exchanges considering their traded volume, it's more of a API integration. Although this could be malicous and give wrong price, it is not a risky trust, also the price is visible on the main page of the PoS. If you think this is a trust in 3rd party I can add some details regarding this to the thesis

*[92] I don’t understand the riskless transactions part. It seems you just added a number of a database… are you also giving the ability to do the exchange right away?
-> This is realtime exchange, However as an agreement, cashing out the Bitcoins would happen in monthly basis or within a threshold (\eg when reached 100 dollars).

-[92] if the transaction… -> sentence does not seem to end
-[96] First coffee to the best of our knowlege

-[98] What does universal framework mean?
-[98] they are necessary first steps.

List of Bugs:
	 - List of Figures is shows on the table of contents as in page I (correct one is V) and also the hyperlink jumps to the title page!
	 - Names on the titles page are shown under the line?
	 - The whole text is a bit to the right of the page?
